  "Inheritance scheme for BibLaTeX cross-referencing.
Inheritances are specified for pairs of source and target entry
type, where the target is the cross-referencing entry and the
source the cross-referenced entry.  Each pair specifies the
fields in the source and the fields in the target that they
correspond with.

Inheritances valid for all entry types are defined by specifying
the entry type as \"all\".  The entry type may also be a
comma-separated list of entry types.

If no inheritance rule is set up for a given entry type+field
combination, the field inherits from the same-name field in the
cross-referenced entry.  If no inheritance should take place, the
target field is set to the symbol `none'.")

;;; Parser primitives
;;
;; The parser is divided into a set of primitives, which do the actual
;; reading, and a set of grammar rules, which describe the syntax of a
;; BibTeX file.
;;
;; A few things to keep in mind:
;;
;; - The primitives are BibTeX-agnostic. They read specific chunks of the
;;   source and return them.
;;
;; - The primitives can be parameterised; that is, the exact text that they
;;   read may depend on arguments passed to them. The grammar rules do not
;;   have any parameters.
;;
;; - The primitives are responsible for skipping whitespace.

  "Parse one or more bibliography files.
FILES is the list of files to parse.  All bibliographic entries
in FILES are collected and returned in a single hash table.
FILES can be a list of `.bib' or `.json' files, or a combination
of these.  FILES can also be a string, which should be the path
to a single bibliography file.

ENTRIES, if provided, should be a hash table with test function
`equal', it is used to store the entries.  Any existing entries
with identical keys are overwritten.  If provided, ENTRIES is
also the return value.  If ENTRIES is nil, a new hash table is
created and returned.

STRINGS, similarly a hash table with test function `equal', is
used to store the @String definitions.  Although STRINGS is not
returned, it is modified in place and can therefore be used to
collect the @String definitions in the files being parsed.

If DISPLAY is non-nil, field values are returned in a way that is
suitable for display: in `.bib' files, @String abbreviations are
expanded, in `.json' files, values that are not strings are
converted to strings.  Furthermore, sequences of white space
characters (including newlines) are reduced to a single space.

Specifically, setting DISPLAY means setting the arguments
EXPAND-STRINGS and INHERITANCES in the function
`parsebib-parse-bib-buffer' and setting STRINGIFY and YEAR-ONLY
in the function `parsebib-parse-json-buffer'.  DISPLAY is simply
passed on to these arguments, which means that it can be set to
anything that INHERITANCES in `parsebib-parse-bib-buffer'
accepts.  (The other arguments only distinguish between nil and
non-nil.) Note that DISPLAY defaults to t.

FIELDS is a list of the field names to be read and included in
the result.  Fields not in the list are ignored.  Note that field
names should be strings; when parsing a `.json' file, they are
converted to symbols.  See the doc strings of
`parsebib-parse-bib-buffer' and `parsebib-parse-json-buffer' for
details.  If FIELDS is nil, all fields are returned."
